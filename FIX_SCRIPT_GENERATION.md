# 🔧 Fix Script Generation Error

## ✅ What I Fixed

1. **Better error handling** - Shows specific error messages
2. **API key validation** - Checks if OpenAI API key is configured
3. **Model fallback** - Tries GPT-4, falls back to GPT-3.5-turbo if not available
4. **Video selection optional** - Can generate scripts without uploading a video first
5. **Better error messages** - Shows exactly what went wrong

## 🚨 Most Common Issue: Missing OpenAI API Key

The error "Failed to generate script" usually means:
- ❌ OpenAI API key is not set in `.env` file
- ❌ API key is invalid or expired
- ❌ No billing set up on OpenAI account

## 🔑 Quick Fix: Add OpenAI API Key

### Step 1: Get Your API Key
1. Go to: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
2. Sign up or log in
3. Click "Create new secret key"
4. Copy the key (starts with `sk-`)

### Step 2: Add to .env File
```powershell
# Open .env file in your project root
# Add this line:
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-key-here
```

### Step 3: Restart Dev Server
```powershell
# Stop server (Ctrl+C)
npm run dev
```

## 🧪 Test Script Generation

1. Go to: `/dashboard/scripts/create`
2. Fill in the form:
   - Topic: "how to make your first $10k"
   - Platform: Instagram
   - Tone: Motivational
   - Length: 30 seconds
3. Video selection is now **optional** - you can leave it empty
4. Click "Generate Script"
5. Should work now! ✅

## 🔍 Error Messages Explained

### "OpenAI API key not configured"
→ Add `OPENAI_API_KEY` to your `.env` file

### "Invalid OpenAI API key"
→ Check your API key is correct (starts with `sk-`)

### "OpenAI API quota exceeded"
→ Add billing to your OpenAI account at https://platform.openai.com/account/billing

### "OpenAI API rate limit exceeded"
→ Wait a moment and try again

## 💡 Tips

1. **Start with GPT-3.5-turbo** - It's cheaper and faster
   - The code automatically falls back to GPT-3.5-turbo if GPT-4 isn't available
   
2. **Video is optional** - You can generate scripts without uploading a video first
   - Uploading a video helps the AI understand your style better
   - But it's not required for basic script generation

3. **Check terminal logs** - Look at the terminal where `npm run dev` is running
   - You'll see detailed error messages there

## ✅ Success Indicators

After adding API key, you should see:
- ✅ Script generates successfully
- ✅ Redirects to script detail page
- ✅ Script content is displayed
- ✅ No error messages

The script generation should work now! 🎉
